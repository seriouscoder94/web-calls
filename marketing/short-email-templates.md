Your [Instagram] posts are great! Have you thought about turning that content into a website? I just helped [similar local business] do this and they're getting 30+ new customers each month from Google searches alone.

Hi [First Name],

Tried finding your business hours online yesterday - had to call instead. A lot of people probably do the same.

I create simple websites for local businesses. Nothing fancy, just the basics people search for: hours, location, services. Usually takes about a week to set up.

Interested in seeing some examples?

Best,
