## For Businesses Without a Website

### 1. Restaurant/Food Service
```
Subject: [Restaurant Name] menu question

Hey [First Name],

Just tried ordering from your place through DoorDash, but couldn't find you. A friend recommended your [signature dish] and mentioned you do takeout.

I help local restaurants get more orders through their own websites (no third-party fees!). One of my clients, [Local Restaurant], now gets 40% of their orders online, saving $2,000+ monthly in delivery app fees.

Quick 10-min chat about it?

### 2. Service Business (Plumber, Electrician, etc.)
```
Subject: Noticed something about [Business Name]

Hi [First Name],

I was searching for emergency [service type] in [city] last night and saw your great Google reviews, but no website. You're missing out on a lot of after-hours calls - most people won't leave a voicemail anymore.

I create simple websites for [service] businesses that:
- Show up when people search "[service] near me"
- Let customers request quotes 24/7
- Display your license and insurance info
- Share those great reviews you already have

Want to see how [competitor] is getting 70% of their leads from their website?

### 3. Retail Store
```
Subject: Quick idea for [Store Name]

Hey [First Name],

Love your store on [Street Name]! Tried finding your holiday hours on Google but had to call instead. You probably get that a lot.

I help local shops get found online. Simple website, big results:
- Show up in local Google searches
- Display real-time store hours
- Share product photos/info
- Collect customer emails

[Similar Store] started with just a basic site last month - already got 25 new customers who found them on Google.

### 4. Professional Services (Law, Accounting, etc.)
```
Subject: [Business Name] digital presence

Hi [First Name],

Your [industry] expertise is impressive - just read your review from [Client Name] on Google. But without a website, potential clients might be going to competitors who are easier to find online.

I specialize in professional service websites that:
- Build credibility with case studies
- Generate leads while you sleep
- Share your expertise through blogs
- Rank for local [industry] searches

[Competitor] gets 15-20 qualified leads per month from their website. Want to see how?

Best,
[Your name]
```

### 5. Beauty/Wellness
```
Subject: Online booking for [Salon/Spa Name]?

Hey [First Name],

Tried booking an appointment at your [salon/spa] last night - noticed you only take bookings by phone. In 2024, most people prefer booking online (especially outside business hours).

I create simple websites with online booking that:
- Let clients book 24/7 (while you sleep!)
- Reduce no-shows with automatic reminders
- Show your work portfolio
- Collect reviews automatically

One of my clients, [Salon Name], now books 80% of appointments online, saving 15+ hours weekly on phone calls.

### 6. Auto Services
```
Subject: [Auto Shop Name] online scheduling?

Hi [First Name],

Your reviews on [platform] are fantastic! But noticed people can't schedule service appointments online. Most dealerships offer this now - but your pricing and service quality are better.

I help independent shops compete with dealerships online:
- 24/7 appointment scheduling
- Service history tracking
- Automated maintenance reminders
- Easy estimate requests

[Local Shop] added online scheduling last month - already getting 30+ appointments/week through their website.

### 7. Real Estate
```
Subject: Expanding [Agency Name]'s reach?

Hey [First Name],

Saw your listings on Zillow - impressive portfolio! But without your own website, you're missing chances to:
- Showcase properties before they hit MLS
- Collect buyer/seller leads 24/7
- Share market insights
- Build your personal brand

I help agents create lead-generating websites. [Agent Name] got 12 qualified leads their first month after launch.

### 8. Fitness/Training
```
Subject: Digital presence for [Gym/Studio Name]

Hi [First Name],

Your Instagram content is ðŸ”¥! But without a website, potential clients can't:
- See your full class schedule
- Book sessions online
- Buy packages/memberships
- Read success stories

I create websites that turn social followers into paying clients. [Studio Name] converted 40 Instagram followers into members last month through their new site.

### 9. Event Venue
```
Subject: [Venue Name] booking system?

Hey [First Name],

Your space on [Street] is beautiful! But noticed couples have to call/email for availability. In 2024, most people want to:
- Check dates instantly
- See pricing packages
- View virtual tours
- Request quotes online

I help venues automate bookings. [Similar Venue] now books 70% of tours through their website.

### 10. Contractor/Construction
```
Subject: Online presence for [Company Name]

Hi [First Name],

Your work on [Recent Project/Location] looks amazing! But without a website, you're missing out on high-end clients who:
- Research contractors extensively online
- Want to see project portfolios
- Read detailed reviews
- Request quotes after hours

I help contractors showcase their work online. [Contractor Name] got a $200K renovation project through their website last month.

## For Outdated Websites

### 1. Mobile Optimization
```
Subject: Quick observation about [Business Name]

Hey [First Name],

Just tried viewing your website on my iPhone - noticed it's a bit tricky to navigate. With 72% of searches now happening on phones, this might be costing you customers.

I help businesses like yours get more from their online presence:
- Mobile-friendly design
- Faster loading speeds
- Easy contact forms
- Click-to-call buttons

[Similar Business] saw a 45% increase in leads after their mobile update last month.

### 2. E-commerce Update
```
Subject: Modernizing [Store Name]'s online sales

Hi [First Name],

Your products are great, but your current website makes ordering difficult on phones. Quick fixes could help:
- One-click checkout
- Real-time inventory
- Automatic order updates
- Mobile payment options

[Similar Store] doubled online sales after these updates.
